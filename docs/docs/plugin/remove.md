description: How to remove a plugin repository from the community plugins
---

Repositories can be removed from the plugin database for various reasons. Some common examples include:

- The repository has been abandoned and is no longer maintained.
- The plugin causes critical issues or breaks RotorHazard core functionality.
- It contains malicious code, such as credential theft or unauthorized data collection.
- The repository has been deleted, made private, or is otherwise inaccessible.

## Requesting removal

If you believe a repository should be removed, follow these steps:

1. Open an issue in the [community plugins repository](https://github.com/RotorHazard/community-plugins/issues) using the [**Request for repository removal** issue template](https://github.com/RotorHazard/community-plugins/issues/new?assignees=klaasnicolaas&labels=removal&projects=&template=removal.yml).
2. Clearly state the reason for removal and provide any relevant evidence or links.
3. A maintainer will review the request and take appropriate action.

Once a repository is removed, it will no longer be listed in the community plugins database.
