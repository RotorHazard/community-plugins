# Licensing & Legal

## What license should I use for my plugin?

Popular choices include:

- **MIT**: Very permissive, allows commercial use
- **GPL-3.0**: Copyleft, derivatives must be open source
- **Apache-2.0**: Permissive with patent protection

Choose a license compatible with RotorHazard's license. Add the `license` and `license_uri` fields to your `manifest.json`.

## Can I charge for my plugin?

No. All plugins in the community database must be **free to use for all types of events**. This is a core requirement to ensure accessibility for the community.

## Can I keep part of my code private?

Generally, no. The source code must be publicly available. In exceptional cases, limited exceptions may be made on an individual basis. Get in contact to discuss your specific situation.
