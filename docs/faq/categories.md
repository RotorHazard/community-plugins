# Categories & Organization

## How do I choose the right category for my plugin?

Select the category that best describes your plugin's primary function. Available categories are defined in [`categories.json`](https://github.com/RotorHazard/community-plugins/blob/main/categories.json).

If you're unsure, ask in the pull request comments.

## Can my plugin be in multiple categories?

No, each plugin must be assigned to **exactly one category** in the `categories.json` file. This is enforced by our validation checks to keep the database organized and prevent confusion.

Choose the category that best represents your plugin's primary purpose.

## What if there's no suitable category for my plugin?

You can suggest a new category by opening an issue in the [community-plugins repository](https://github.com/RotorHazard/community-plugins/issues).
