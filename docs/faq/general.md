# General Questions

## What is a RotorHazard plugin?

A RotorHazard plugin is a modular extension that adds new functionality to the RotorHazard timing system. Plugins can add features like custom race formats, LED control, voice callouts, data export capabilities, and much more.

## How do I install a plugin?

Plugins from the community database can be installed directly through the RotorHazard web interface (UI):

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page in RotorHazard
2. Go to the **Plugins** section
3. Click **Browse Community Plugins** to see the available plugins
4. Click **Install** and restart RotorHazard when prompted

## Are plugins safe to use?

All plugins in the community database are open source and publicly available on GitHub. The code can be reviewed by anyone. However, always review the plugin's code and release notes before installing, especially for critical race events.

## Can I use multiple plugins at the same time?

Yes! RotorHazard supports running multiple plugins simultaneously. However, be aware that some plugins might conflict with each other if they modify the same functionality.
